so 
one 
so I want to 
what I want to do it for me 10 minutes to 
but right now what I need your help is what is going to the top talking to Minnesota heated discussion hold everything like that 
to be fair 
every semester we have a start of this 
to do that 
% reset next up we have a start of this and 
% 
we need to 
% who we need to do 
well I mean I'm gonna say that I have a vested interest in going to this lunch because I am going to get a free lunch but that's just my opinion 
 
 
so 
they 
so we 
do we need a leader or 
because 
what what what what what kind of arrangement 
what what what what what kind of the parade 
% 
nmls 
you can pretend on whether we have 
 
 
WNED 
and then you guys 
but I but I need to give 
or at least 
just 
but I but I need to give you read 
a restaurant point of view 
all propose scheduling in the time of the event 
I guess I'm just here for the free 
%  % 
 
NBCU 
alright now well what else is there I guess when 
transportation   
how far away it is 
will need transportation 
 I'm the one 
person nbspw 
so what the how and the why 
 
people 
so 
one 
 I can the location you can do it up  
you know you have a list of the things that 
so 
nmls 
so 
we need to celebrate them 
so those are the 2 things on 
I this 
you guys want 
right right 
and and I 
right okay 
 I do forestall 
that's fair  
there turn prices in the first % we also I mean this is really we never went to 
true 
so 
% 
and we go right 
okay so that's 
okay so that 
and then for a time 
focus on 
 
and go do we just 
% 
you have 
yes I have started 
yes 
you 
n't 
% 
so so let's say you know do we want to start % and 
 
 I've been on as well for the whole time 
okay 
 
 we're we're agreeing right now on the format  
okay 
this is this is a group discussion in itself organizing everyone's role 
right 
so I propose Chinese restaurants because of need we need to celebrate the minded project and I give me said % veto and we haven't been there yet since a lot of was joined season 
 I think it's very fitting I like that idea 
nmap 
so I think we have an agreement between 2 people I need to know what you guys think about the Chinese cuisine 
n't 
good good well what do you think if and I mean let's talk about the money later 
and 
so 
so we either go to 
and that 
there 
there 
okay 
you can here 
so what what are the other day so that we could go to 
 I mean ideally something closer 8 because 
we always talked about 
I n't 
yet looking corners pretty good it's % downtown so I think we get more people to show up because it's a little closer it's within walking distance 
 
I don't think 
all  
 
% it's on third street Edsel further down  
corner Chinese or have a very small from what I see 
 some good % some good lunch combo deals 
 
 
I have n't 
if we could be version by the dozen seem to % befitting in the theme of Chinese restaurants that 
and it's kind of far away so 
and it's kind of far away 
we will of a hard time getting people to show up 
 
it's reasonable  
from the injury I like in the local 
n't 
 ideally downtown 
I might be I 
 something and try 
% I think our options are Holly and red and blue 
 
are lucky going 
 
 
but if we 
but if we really going 
  so good  
 
definitely yes 
you 
 I remember so well let's 
 
is this like a full lab invite or is this like % how we did like the little take out thing and I once cafe or inviting like how we went to the shop and 
you're talking about 
so I think it's going to be like 
so I think it's going to be 
like 
a mix between the shop and our take out 90 
 
it's like a 
have you ever been to any up 
I personally don't like 
have you have you been to any of these are what's your opinion on any 
% I'm a very picky eater and I look 
 
I personally don't like how way % I'm a very picky eater and I look at the menu and I do not like a single thing on the vehicle 
nmhg 
nice 
 
%  I'd say red and blue interests because of the quality and it's about the same distance from the lab so I think 
more people show up 
this is 
because if we 
NQA 
because if we are talking about 
right 
 
okay 
no put up 
perfect 
that's great  perfect 
really close 
 
 
ndpl 
from 
% 
but you're not here I'm not 
okay 
more 
zoom in the morning 
okay 
give have 
 I don't think there's any holidays coming up and because like that might be a good day if there is a upcoming holiday because 
well 
presidents news coming up soon in about 2 weeks 3 weeks 0 Feb 71 
 another would open up another open of availability for students because then they'd have 
all they reasoning given to lunch then if it's a holiday 
 
so 
 
which 
preferably on Friday so that go no one knows anything some make the next day on like some class to be the next day 
so we have to 
making progress so we have 
I might be too short notice 
% the week 
next week Friday should still be like 
so over a week 
one 's love first round of like exams 
let others generally like classes overlap and they have like 
% your first round 
one week 
this would be a great Watson question 
Watson and I the exams 
 
I mean front  we've IBM or a Friday data and around this time and if we have to go for Friday's posted Tuesday then just in case there are 
% mid terms or exam ones 
 
 I mean there's nothing less than on the act and 
under fight it's probably a third of the way through this 
n't 
 
WNED 
I think we can
